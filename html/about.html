    <p>The Bird Stop has been an ever evolving venture since first opening their doors in 2011. This small family owned business has brought great coffee, food, and community to the heart of Caldwell, ID.</p>
    <p>First starting out as a small hone in the wall shop, the Bird Stop soon outgrew their location after adding food and live music to their venue.</p>
    <p>As fate would have it, a much larger vacant building just one block away was available. The Bird Stop found its new home is an old historic bank in Downtown Caldwell. All renovations have been done by the family and the beautifull old building recieved the much needed face lift it deserved.</p>
    <p>The Kelly family have no plans for rest anytime soon. On top of running the coffeeshop with a full menu and bar, they plan to expand business with a larger room for live music, a restaurant upstairs, and a brewery. Caldwell is an up and coming city once again and the Kelly family is playing a large role in that.</p>
    <p>Their Cinderella story is nothing short of amazing and the Kelly's are some of the sweetest people around. Grab a coffee or a beer at the Bird Stop and chances are you will hear their story and be comforted with great food, great drinks, and amazing people.</p>
